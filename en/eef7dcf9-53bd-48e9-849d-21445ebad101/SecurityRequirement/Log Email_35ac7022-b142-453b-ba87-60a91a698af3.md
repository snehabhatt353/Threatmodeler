  "description": "<p>In security today it is necessary for application, servers, clients, Operating Systems (OS) and networking devices such as routers, firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS) to log traffic and events. </p><p>This applies to email clients and servers as well. We log because bad things happen, not because things work. It is necessary to be able to look at the record of all email subjects, senders, and attachments. That way if a compromise occurs it will be possible (hopefully) to track what occurred when and where.</p><p>If a Phishing email is detected all recipients who might have received the same email should be informed immediately. Phishing emails contain links or attachments that when a user interacts with it or clicks on it they will be directed (redirected) to a malicious site or it will open a door for a bad actor to access their computer and from their the corporate network.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging_(software)\" target=\"_blank\">Logging (software) - Wikipedia</a><br /></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing\" target=\"_blank\">Phishing - Wikipedia</a><br /></p>",
