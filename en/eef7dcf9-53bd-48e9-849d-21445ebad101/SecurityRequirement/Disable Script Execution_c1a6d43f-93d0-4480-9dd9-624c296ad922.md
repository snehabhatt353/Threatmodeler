  "description": "<p>Webroot has discovered ransomware variants delivered through email attachments as well. These malicious attachments are often a zip archive that contain a script, which serves the purpose of downloading/executing a ransomware/malware payload. Webroot recommends preventing the execution of script file types to avoid this type of attack.</p><p>In order to prevent these types of documents and scripts from running we recommend choosing the most appropriate solution for your environment below.Â </p><p>Block WSF, VBS, WSH, HTA, VBS and JS files.</p><p>If possible, disable script execution in the administrative interface.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Implementation:</b></p><p>REDIRECT SCRIPT FILE EXTENSIONS VIA GPOTo enable this policy setting, access the system set up for policy control and navigate to the following setting:User Configuration - Preferences - Control Panel - Settings</p><p>Right-click on Folder Options and navigate to New &gt; Open With.Type in the each unwanted extension, i.e. wsf, js, vbs into the &quot;File extension&quot; box, then input the path of a program you want to have as default to open the file.</p><p>Tick Set as default and press OK.Example of redirecting the extension .wsf, .js, and .vbs to notepad:</p><p>We recommend redirecting the file types: .hta, .jse, .js, .vbs, .vbe, .wsf, .wsh, and .ps1.If a system administrator needs to run a WSF, VBS, JS, or any other script file, this can still be achieved by starting the WScript program with the script file as an argument.For example:: C:WindowsSystem32WSCRIPT.exe C:example.vbs</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Reference:</b></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://community.webroot.com/webroot-business-endpoint-protection-20/disable-execution-of-script-files-303074\">https://community.webroot.com/webroot-business-endpoint-protection-20/disable-execution-of-script-files-303074</a></p>",
