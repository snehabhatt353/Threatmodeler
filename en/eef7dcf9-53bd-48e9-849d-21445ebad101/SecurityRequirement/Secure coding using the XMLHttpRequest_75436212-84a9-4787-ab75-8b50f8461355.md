  "description": "<p><b>XML HTTP Request: </b>The main disadvantages of building web applications is that once a particular webpage is loaded within the userâ€™s browser, the related server connection is cut off. Further browsing (even) within the page itself requires establishing another connection with the server and sending the whole page back even though the user might have simply wanted to expand a simple link. XML HTTP Request allows asynchronous data retrieval or ensuring that the page does not reload in its entirety each time the user requests the smallest of changes.</p><p>Service provider should not use the XMLHttpRequest method to create a local proxy for content from other sites, because the client will not be able to discern what content comes from which host.<br><br><br><br></p>",
