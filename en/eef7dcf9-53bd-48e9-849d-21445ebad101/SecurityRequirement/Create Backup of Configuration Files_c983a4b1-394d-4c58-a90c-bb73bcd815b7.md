  "description": "<p><b>Backing Up Configuration Files</b><br><br>A backup copy of the server and&nbsp; system configuration files can be created and stored in case of emergency or for scheduled hardware or operating system upgrades. </p><p>If a hardware (e.g., disk failure) or software failure should occur that requires the re-installation of the operating system, the saved configuration can be restored using the files created when the system configuration was backed up.<br><br>The best practice is to backup the configuration regularly. The configuration should always be backed up before and after making major configuration changes, and before upgrading the software or rebuilding a Server.</p>",
