  "description": "When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, &quot;boat&quot; may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as &quot;red&quot; or &quot;blue.&quot;",
