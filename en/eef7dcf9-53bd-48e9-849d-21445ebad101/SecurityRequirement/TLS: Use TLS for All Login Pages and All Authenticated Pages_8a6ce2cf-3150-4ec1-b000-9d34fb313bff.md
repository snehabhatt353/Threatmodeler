  "name": "TLS: Use TLS for All Login Pages and All Authenticated Pages",
  "description": "<p>The login page and all subsequent authenticated pages must be exclusively accessed over TLS. The initial login page, referred to as the &quot;login landing page&quot;, must be served over TLS. Failure to utilize TLS for the login landing page allows an attacker to modify the login form action, causing the user's credentials to be posted to an arbitrary location. Failure to utilize TLS for authenticated pages after the login enables an attacker to view the unencrypted session ID and compromise the user's authenticated session.</p><p>HTTPS is a secure extension of HTTP. Websites that install and configure an SSL/TLS certificate can use the HTTPS protocol to establish a secure connection with the server.The goal of SSL/TLS is to make it safe and secure to transmit sensitive information including personal data, payment or login information.\r</p><p>It’s an alternative to plain text data transfer in which your connection to a server is unencrypted, and it makes it harder for crooks and hackers to snoop on the connection and steal your data.\r</p><p>Most people are familiar with SSL/TLS certificates, which are used by webmasters to secure their websites and to provide a secure way for people to carry out transactions.\r</p><p>You can tell when a website is using one because you’ll see a little padlock icon next to the URL in the address bar. </p><p><b>Implementing steps:</b></p><p>In order to ensure that your website is secure, you must install an SSL certificate. The easiest way to setup an SSL certificate on your website is to simply contact your webhost provider. When you submit a request to purchase an SSL certificate, your webhost provider will install the SSL certificate for you. Once the SSL certificate is installed, your website will load via https and will therefore be secure. \r</p><p>\rHow to Make a Secure Login Form with SSL: Please refer to the link below for step by step process </p><p><a href=\"https://www.sslshopper.com/article-how-to-make-a-secure-login-form-with-ssl.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sslshopper.com/article-how-to-make-a-secure-login-form-with-ssl.html</a></p><p><b>Resources:</b></p><p><a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet</a><a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-ssl-tls-https\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-ssl-tls-https</a></p><p><a href=\"https://support.payjunction.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004103353-How-Do-I-Make-My-Website-Secure-SSL-TLS-Setup-\" target=\"_blank\">https://support.payjunction.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004103353-How-Do-I-Make-My-Website-Secure-SSL-TLS-Setup-</a></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>",
