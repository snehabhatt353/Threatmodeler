  "description": "Applications frequently fail to encrypt network traffic when it is necessary to protect sensitive communications. Encryption (usually SSL) must be used for all authenticated connections, especially Internet-accessible web pages, but backend connections as well. Otherwise, the application will expose an authentication or session token. In addition, encryption should be used whenever sensitive data, such as credit card or health information is transmitted. Applications that fall back or can be forced out of an encrypting mode can be abused by attackers. [OWASP]\nThe ESAPI way of performing this task is also very simple. This can be done by using the assertSecureChannel method as in the following snippet.\n//this method can throw an AccessControlException\n\n//uses the current http request - there is an overloaded method that accepts\n//a specified http request object as a parameter\nESAPI.httpUtilities().assertSecureChannel();\n\nReference: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007-Insecure_Communications",
