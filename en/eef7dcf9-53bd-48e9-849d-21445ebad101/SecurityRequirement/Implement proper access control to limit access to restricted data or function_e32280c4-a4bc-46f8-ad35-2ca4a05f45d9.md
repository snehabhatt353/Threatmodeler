  "description": "<p>Restricted data like PII should have proper access controls implemented to prevent unauthorized access to it.\n\nImplement the following protections for any intact restricted data you must retain: \nA. Encrypt it:\n\nRestricted data MUST be encrypted when it is transmitted. This includes email, online, remote access, file transfers, and workstation/server communications.\nIf you need to send files or attachments containing restricted data, work with ITS to set up a way to send them securely.\nAvoid standard (unencrypted) email and unencrypted Instant Messaging (IM).\nSee Send Passwords and Restricted Data Securely for additional information and pointers.\nEncrypt stored restricted data when possible. Work with ITS to determine if this is an appropriate option. Also see Encryption Information.\nThis is especially important for portable and mobile devices.\nB. Authorized use only:\n\nBe sure that you have proper authorization and training prior to accessing restricted data.\nNever share or discuss restricted data with unauthorized individuals.\nYou may also be required to read and sign UCSC's Access to Information Statement (required for all ITS staff).\nC. Use passwords that can't be easily guessed, and protect your passwords:\n\nPasswords that protect restricted data must meet UCSC's Password Standards. In short, they must use a mixture of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols; and be at least 8 characters in length (or at least 10 if they’re less complex). See the Standards for additional requirements.\nPassword protect all of your devices.\nDon’t share your passwords or private account information.\nUse different passwords for accounts that provide access to restricted data than for your less-sensitive accounts.\nAlso use different passwords for university and personal accounts.\nBe aware that you may get locked out of university systems after multiple failed login attempts.\n</p><p>\nReference: <a href=\"http://its.ucsc.edu/policies/rd.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://its.ucsc.edu/policies/rd.html</a></p>",
