  "description": "<p>Use a vetted library or framework that does not allow this weakness to occur or provides constructs that make this weakness easier to avoid.\nExamples include:\n\nOWASP ESAPI:\nESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web application security control library that makes it easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications. </p><p>The ESAPI libraries are designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications. The ESAPI libraries also serve as a solid foundation for new development.\n</p><p>\nMicrosoft Enterprise Library:\nMicrosoft Enterprise Library is a collection of application blocks designed to assist developers with common enterprise development challenges. Application blocks are a type of guidance, provided as source code that can be used \"as is,\" extended, or modified by developers for use in enterprise development projects.\n\n</p><p>Microsoft Anti-XSS:\nAntiXSS helps you to protect your current applications from cross-site scripting attacks, at the same time helping you to protect your legacy application with its Security Runtime Engine. </p><p>Working with customer and partner feedback, AntiXSS incorporates radically and innovatively rethought features, offering you a newer, more powerful weapon against the often employed cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.\n</p><p>\nSuhosin (Hardened PHP):\nSuhosin is an advanced protection system for PHP installations. It was designed to protect servers and users from known and unknown flaws in PHP applications and the PHP core. Suhosin comes in two independent parts, that can be used separately or in combination. </p><p>The first part is a small patch against the PHP core, that implements a few low-level protections against bufferoverflows or format string vulnerabilities and the second part is a powerful PHP extension that implements all the other protections.</p>",
