  "name": "Encryption: Always ensure data integrity and authenticity",
  "description": "<p>Data integrity is the overall accuracy, completeness, and consistency of data. Data integrity also refers to the safety of data in regards to regulatory compliance — such as GDPR compliance — and security. It is maintained by a collection of processes, rules, and standards implemented during the design phase. </p><p>When the integrity of data is secure, the information stored in a database will remain complete, accurate, and reliable no matter how long it’s stored or how often it’s accessed. Data integrity also ensures that your data is safe from any outside forces.</p><p /><div>Digital data can be assumed to be authentic if it is provable that it has not been corrupted after its creation. In a strong sense, any processing means corruption, that is digital data to be authentic must be only the outcome of an acquisition process of a real world scene without any successively processing; but in a wide sense, authentic data must accordingly represent a real world scene and even if some processing has been probably applied the meaning of the scene must not be modified. &quot;</div><div><br /></div><div>Encryption must be always combined with message integrity protection. Otherwise the ciphertext will be vulnerable to padding oracle attack and data manipulation, especially if it's being passed over untrusted channel (e.g. in an URL or cookie).\n\nWhen implementing encryption prefer APIs that offer encryption storage with built-in integrity protection, such as Encryptor class (OWASP ESAPI 2.0) or DataProtector class (.NET Framework 4.5).\n\nIf implementing own encryption mechanism, use cryptographic cipher modes that offer both confidentiality and authenticity (AE) under uniform API. </div><div><br /></div><div>Recommended modes include CCM, GCM and OCB (patented).\n\nIf not using AE, combine encryption in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode with post-encryption message authentication code, such as HMAC or UMAC. Do not use ECB mode.\n\n</div><div><br /></div><div>&quot;It is almost impossible to minimize data integrity risk with just one approach, making it a better option to use a combination of several tactics. </div><div><br /></div><div><b>Some of the most effective ways to reduce data integrity risks include: \n</b></div><ul><li>Promote a Culture of Integrity \n</li><li>Implement Quality Control Measures \n</li><li>Create an Audit Trail \n</li><li>Develop Process Maps for All Critical Data</li><li>Eliminate Known Security Vulnerabilities \n</li><li>Follow a Software Development Lifecycle \n</li><li>Validate Your Computer Systems \n</li><li>Implement Error Detection Software</li></ul><div><br /></div><div> \n</div><div>To ensure the data authenticity we should implement the following:\n</div><ul><li>Data encryption at Rest\n</li><li>Multi factor authentication\n</li><li>Digital signature \n</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Based on the internationally accepted OpenPGP standard we use Public Key cryptography to secure data authenticity and integrity with digital signatures and encryption.\n</div><div><br /></div><div>Reference: </div><div><a href=\"https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/data-authenticity/6684\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/data-authenticity/6684</a></div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-data-integrity/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-data-integrity/</a></div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet</a></div><div><br /></div><p />",
