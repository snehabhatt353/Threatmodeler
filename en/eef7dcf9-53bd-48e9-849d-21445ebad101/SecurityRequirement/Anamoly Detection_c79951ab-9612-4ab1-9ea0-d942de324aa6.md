  "description": "<b>Anomaly</b> <b>detection</b> (or outlier detection) is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. Typically, anomalous data can be connected to some kind of problem or rare event such as e.g. bank fraud, medical problems, structural defects, malfunctioning equipment etc. This connection makes it very interesting to be able to pick out which data points can be considered anomalies, as identifying these events are typically very interesting from a business perspective.<br><br>Anomaly-based network intrusion detection plays a vital role in protecting networks against malicious activities. In recent years, data mining techniques have gained importance in addressing security issues in network. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) aim to identify intrusions with a low false alarm rate and a high detection rate. Although classification-based data mining techniques are popular, they are not effective to detect unknown attacks. Unsupervised learning methods have been given a closer look for network IDS, which are insignificant to detect dynamic intrusion activities. <br><br>The recent contributions in literature focus on machine learning techniques to build anomaly-based intrusion detection systems, which extract the knowledge from training phase. Though existing intrusion detection techniques address the latest types of attacks like DoS, Probe, U2R, and R2L, reducing false alarm rate is a challenging issue. <br>",
