This can include validating source addresses, user names, ACLs or other data that indicates authorization. This need not be done inline at the time the data is processed, but can be done after the processing has occurred to detect attack.\n2\tCorrective\t\nApply transaction-based logic to systems whose initial authorization cannot be better controlled.
