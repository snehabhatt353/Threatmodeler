  "description": "Reflected Cross Site Scripting:<br />A black-box test will include at least three phases:<br /><br />1. Detect input vectors. The tester must determine the web application's variables and how to input them in the web application. See the example below.<br /><br />2. Analyze each input vector to detect potential vulnerabilities. To detect an XSS vulnerability, the tester will typically use specially crafted input data with each input vector. Such input data is typically harmless, but trigger responses from the web browser that manifests the vulnerability. Testing data can be generated by using a web application fuzzer or manually. Some example of such input data are the following:&nbsp;<br /><br />&lt;script&gt;alert(123)&lt;/script&gt;<br /><br />&ldquo;&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;<br /><br />3. For each vulnerability reported in the previous phase, the tester will analyze the report and attempt to exploit it with an attack that has a realistic impact on the web application's security.&nbsp;<br />",
