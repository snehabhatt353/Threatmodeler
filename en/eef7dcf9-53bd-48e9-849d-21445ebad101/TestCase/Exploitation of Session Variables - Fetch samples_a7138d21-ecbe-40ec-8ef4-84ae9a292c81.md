  "description": "An attacker fetches many samples of a session ID. This may be through legitimate access (logging in, legitimate connections, etc) or just systematic probing.\n\nAttack Step Techniques:\n1\tAn attacker makes many anonymous connections and records the session IDs assigned.\nenv-Web env-Peer2Peer env-CommProtocol env-ClientServer\n\n2\tAn attacker makes authorized connections and records the session tokens or credentials issued.\nenv-Web env-Peer2Peer env-CommProtocol env-ClientServer\n\n3     An attacker gains access to (legitimately or illegitimately) a nearby system (e.g., in the same operations network, DMZ, or local network) and makes a connections from it, attempting to gain the same privileges as a trusted system.\nenv-Peer2Peer env-CommProtocol env-ClientServer\n\nIndicators:\n1\tPositive\t\n\nTrust in the system is based on IP address, MAC address, network locality, or other general network characteristic.\nenv-CommProtocol env-ClientServer env-Peer2Peer\n\n2\tPositive\t\nWeb applications use session IDs\nenv-Web\n\n3\tPositive\t\nNetwork systems issue session IDs or connection IDs\nenv-CommProtocol env-ClientServer env-Peer2Peer\n\nOutcomes:\n1\tSuccess\t\nSystems or applications grant trust based on logical or physical network locality.\n2\tSuccess\t\nSession identifiers successfully spoofed\n3\tFailure\t\nNo session IDs can be found or exploited\n\nSecurity Controls:\n1\tDetective\t\nMonitor logs for unusual amounts of invalid sessions.\n2\tDetective\t\nMonitor logs for unusual amounts of invalid connections or invalid requests from unauthorized hosts.\n\nReference: https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/21.html",
