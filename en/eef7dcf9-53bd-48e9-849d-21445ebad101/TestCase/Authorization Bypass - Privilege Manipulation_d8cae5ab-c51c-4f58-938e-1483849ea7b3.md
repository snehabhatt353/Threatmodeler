  "name": "Authorization Bypass - Privilege Manipulation",
  "description": "In every portion of the application where a user can create information in the database (e.g., making a payment, adding a contact, or sending a message), to receive information (statement of account, order details, etc.), or delete information (drop users, messages, etc.), it is necessary to record that functionality. The tester should try to access such functions as another user in order to verify, for example, if it is possible to access a function that should not be permitted by the user's role/privilege (but might be permitted as another user).\n\nFor example:\nThe following HTTP POST allows the user that belongs to grp001 to access order #0001: \n\nPOST /user/viewOrder.jsp HTTP/1.1\n Host: www.example.com\n ...\n\n gruppoID=grp001&ordineID=0001\n\n\nVerify if a user that does not belong to grp001 can modify the value of the parameters ‘gruppoID’ and ‘ordineID’ to gain access to that privileged data.\n\nFor example:\nThe following server's answer shows a hidden field in the HTML returned to the user after a successful authentication. \n\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: Netscape-Enterprise/6.0\nDate: Wed, 1 Apr 2006 13:51:20 GMT\nSet-Cookie: USER=aW78ryrGrTWs4MnOd32Fs51yDqp; path=/; domain=www.example.com \nSet-Cookie: SESSION=k+KmKeHXTgDi1J5fT7Zz; path=/; domain= www.example.com\nCache-Control: no-cache\nPragma: No-cache \nContent-length: 247\nContent-Type: text/html\nExpires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT\nConnection: close\n\n<form  name=“autoriz\" method=\"POST\" action = “visual.jsp\"> \n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"profilo\" value=\"SistemiInf1\">                                         \n<body onload=\"document.forms.autoriz.submit()\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\nWhat if the tester modifies the value of the variable \"profilo\" to “SistemiInf9”? Is it possible to become administrator?\n\nFor example:\nIn an environment in which the server sends an error message contained as a value in a specific parameter in a set of answer's codes, as the following: \n\n\n@0`1`3`3``0`UC`1`Status`OK`SEC`5`1`0`ResultSet`0`PVValido`-1`0`0` Notifications`0`0`3`Command  Manager`0`0`0` StateToolsBar`0`0`0`    \nStateExecToolBar`0`0`0`FlagsToolBar`0\n\n\nThe server gives an implicit trust to the user. It believes that the user will answer with the above message closing the session. In this condition, verify that it is not possible to escalate privileges by modifying the parameter values. In this particular example, by modifying the `PVValido` value from '-1' to '0' (no error conditions), it may be possible to authenticate as administrator to the server.\n\n",
