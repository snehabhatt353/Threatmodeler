  "description": "Many web applications manage authentication by using session identifiers (session IDs). Therefore, if session ID generation is predictable, a malicious user could be able to find a valid session ID and gain unauthorized access to the application, impersonating a previously authenticated user.\n\n\nIn the following figure, values inside cookies increase linearly, so it could be easy for an attacker to guess a valid session ID.\n\nReference: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Bypassing_Authentication_Schema_(OTG-AUTHN-004)  \n",
