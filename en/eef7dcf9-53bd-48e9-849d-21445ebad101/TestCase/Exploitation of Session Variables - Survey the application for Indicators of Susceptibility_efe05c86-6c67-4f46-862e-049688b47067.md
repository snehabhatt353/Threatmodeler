  "description": "Using a variety of methods, until one is found that applies to the target system. the attacker probes for credentials, session tokens, or entry points that bypass credentials altogether.\n\nAttack Step Techniques:\n1\tSpider all available pages\nenv-Web\n\n2\tAttack known bad interfaces\nenv-Web env-CommProtocol env-ClientServer env-Local\n\nIndicators\n1\tPositive\t\nSession IDs are used\nenv-Web env-Peer2Peer env-ClientServer env-CommProtocol\n\n2\tPositive\t\nOpen access points exist that use no user IDs or passwords, but determine authorization based on message content\nenv-Web env-Peer2Peer env-CommProtocol env-ClientServer env-Local\n\nOutcomes\n1\tSuccess\t\nSession IDs are identifiable\n2\tSuccess\t\nOpen channels are available\n\nSecurity Controls\n\n1\tDetective\t\nMonitor velocity of page fetching in web logs. Humans who view a page and select a link from it will click far slower and far less regularly than tools. Tools make requests very quickly and the requests are typically spaced apart regularly (e.g. 0.8 seconds between them).\n2\tDetective\t\nCreate links on some pages that are visually hidden from web browsers. Using iframes, images, or other HTML techniques, the links can be hidden from web browsing humans, but visible to spiders and programs. A request for the page, then, becomes a good predictor of an automated tool probing the application.\n3\tPreventative\t\nActively monitor the application and either deny or redirect requests from origins that appear to be automated.\n4\tDetective\t\nMonitor velocity of feature activations (non-web software). Humans who activate features (click buttons, request actions, invoke APIs, etc.) will do so far slower and far less regularly than tools. Tools make requests very quickly and the requests are typically spaced apart regularly (e.g. 0.8 seconds between them).\n\nReference: https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/21.html",
