  "description": "It is sometimes possible to expand victory conditions. \nFor example, the attacker might not need to know the exact secret but simply needs a value that produces the same result using a one-way function. While doing this does not reduce the size of the search space, the presence of multiple victory conditions does reduce the likely amount of time that the attacker will need to explore the space before finding a workable value.\n\nReference: https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/112.html",
